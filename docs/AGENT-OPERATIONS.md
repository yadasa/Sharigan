# Agent operations

Use the root `AGENTS.md` as the operational contract. Work independently through authorized processing and retrieval. A model must actually inspect the full video before claiming visual approval; metadata checks are not a substitute. If video review is unavailable, request user review through the UI.

## Commands

```bash
.venv/bin/python workflow.py prepare /path/to/source.mp4 --subject person
.venv/bin/python workflow.py status LOCAL_JOB_ID
.venv/bin/python workflow.py repair-rgb LOCAL_JOB_ID
.venv/bin/python workflow.py review LOCAL_JOB_ID --approve --fingerprint CURRENT_HASH --note "Who reviewed, whole-clip findings, repairs"
.venv/bin/python workflow.py submit LOCAL_JOB_ID --prompt-file prompt.txt --reference /path/to/reference.png
.venv/bin/python workflow.py resume LOCAL_JOB_ID
.venv/bin/python workflow.py hd LOCAL_JOB_ID
.venv/bin/python workflow.py resume LOCAL_JOB_ID --hd
```

Omit `--approve` on the review command to record rejection. `repair-rgb` incurs a new SAM inference: use within the user's authorized repair scope; it explicitly clears approval. Add `--second-reference` for a second image. The server and CLI must not collect/submit the same job concurrently.

## Prompt review

State the real number of subjects, exact identity mapping and reference tokens for the selected mode. Keep appearance references separate from motion/audio. Replace the whole subject in every frame, including hair and clothing outside an imperfect depth silhouette; require matching short hair if the identity has short hair. Keep camera, crop, scene, lighting and timing. Include the verified source dialogue verbatim when known, with exact timing; do not invent a transcript. Use only prepared input's embedded audio for lip synchronization. Preserve source soundtrack in the final mux regardless of generated audio.

Show the exact composed prompt before submission. The UI's **Review submission** uses the same `seedance_bridge.compose_prompt` function as the adapter and includes all appended audio/reference guidance and subject mappings. CLI agents can call that builder locally with their prepared folder, creative prompt and reference paths before showing the text. Prior explicit submission approval remains valid. A new paid creative variation should use a new prepared job rather than overwriting an existing request ID. HD requires explicit approval.

## Review and recovery

Play Mask and Prepared input end-to-end, across cuts and occlusions. Check complete subject coverage, no holes in clothes/arms, hair/hands/feet, chair/background exclusion, border fragments and frame-to-frame stability. Review again after any repair. Never auto-approve solely because inference succeeded.

Replicate prediction responses are saved as `audio-prediction.json`, `sam-raw-request.json`, and depth request metadata. On interruption inspect their IDs/status URLs; retrieve completed output before deciding whether to retry. Preparation does not automatically resume every interrupted stage. Seedance response IDs are persisted; startup and `resume` collect them without a new paid queue call.

The UI exposes RGB mask repair, saved-task collection, recent transformations, naming, persisted processing activity and draft/final selection. Repair clears approval before mutation and is blocked for submitted inputs. Submission previews are bound to the current input, references and API configuration; they must be regenerated after changes. UI inspection is local and never substitutes for complete visual input review.

If queue POST times out before a response ID is saved, check the provider dashboard. Stop automatic retries on this ambiguous outcome. Poll timeouts do not mean a job failed. Report provider failures with the local job/request ID, never credentials. Keep the server running until preview is saved. When completed, show `/runs/LOCAL_JOB_ID/final-preview.mp4` (or `hd/final-preview.mp4`).
